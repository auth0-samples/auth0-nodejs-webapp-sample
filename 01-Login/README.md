# 01-Login

## Running the Sample

Install the dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and replace the values for `AUTH0_CLIENT_ID`, `AUTH0_DOMAIN`, and `AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET` with your Auth0 credentials. If you don't yet have an Auth0 account, [sign up](https://auth0.com/signup) for free.

```bash
# copy configuration and replace with your own
cp .env.example .env
```

If you're using a hosting provider that uses a proxy in front of Node.js, comment in the `trust proxy` configuration in [app.js](https://github.com/auth0-samples/auth0-nodejs-webapp-sample/blob/812bb41fa655a1178f6a33ba54b0aee2397b1917/01-Login/app.js#L63-L70). This is a [`express-session` configuration setting](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session#cookiesecure) that allows for trusting this first proxy.

Run the app.

```bash
npm start
```

The app will be served at `localhost:3000`.

## Running the Sample With Docker

In order to run the example with docker you need to have `docker` installed.

You also need to set the environment variables as explained [previously](#running-the-sample).

Execute in command line `sh exec.sh` to run the Docker in Linux, or `.\exec.ps1` to run the Docker in Windows.

## What is Auth0?

Auth0 helps you to:

* Add authentication with [multiple authentication sources](https://docs.auth0.com/identityproviders), either social like **Google, Facebook, Microsoft Account, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Box, Salesforce, among others**, or enterprise identity systems like **Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS or any SAML Identity Provider**.
* Add authentication through more traditional **[username/password databases](https://docs.auth0.com/mysql-connection-tutorial)**.
* Add support for **[linking different user accounts](https://docs.auth0.com/link-accounts)** with the same user.
* Support for generating signed [Json Web Tokens](https://docs.auth0.com/jwt) to call your APIs and **flow the user identity** securely.
* Analytics of how, when and where users are logging in.
* Pull data from other sources and add it to the user profile, through [JavaScript rules](https://docs.auth0.com/rules).
